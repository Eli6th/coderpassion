During the last three weeks of our curriculum, we guide students in crafting their own projects, making sure they have the support they need to bring their creative ideas to life. To celebrate the hard work and to keep our community strong, we're hosting this joyful event for all our students and their families right here in Lexington. At the event, your child will have 5 minutes to proudly present their project to everyone, with live demos to show off what they've built. It's an opportunity for your children to shine, share their achievements, and enjoy a memorable day with family and friends. Don't let them miss this exciting celebration of creativity and learning!</p>
