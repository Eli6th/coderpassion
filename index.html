                        I’ve done computer science for five years now. I will continue to study computer science and philosophy when I attend Harvard next year. I have worked at Tulip Interfaces on their copilot team implementing AI into their product.
                        I’ve finished LHS’s computer science curriculum: Intro to C++, AP Computer Science A (5 on the AP test), and Advanced Computer Programming. Built a number of other projects as well including <a href="https://www.custom-news.com">Custom-News</a>, a custom newsletter based on people's interest in subjects, and my own video game <a href="https://outrun.eliolcott.com">Outrun</a>.

At LHS, I have taken Intro to C++, Intro to Python, AP Computer science A (5 on exam), and Advanced Computer Programming. I have also been teaching computer science to kids for the past 3 years, at the company KTBYTE, nonprofit KiddoByte, and the nonprofit hackathon I run called LexHack.
