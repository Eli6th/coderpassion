                        I’ve done computer science for five years now. I will continue to study computer science and philosophy when I attend Harvard next year. I have worked at Tulip Interfaces on their copilot team implementing AI into their product.
                        I’ve finished LHS’s computer science curriculum: Intro to C++, AP Computer Science A (5 on the AP test), and Advanced Computer Programming. Built a number of other projects as well including <a href="https://www.custom-news.com">Custom-News</a>, a custom newsletter based on people's interest in subjects, and my own video game <a href="https://outrun.eliolcott.com">Outrun</a>.

                        I am a rising freshman at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and I will be majoring in Computer Science and Business. I graduated in the top 10% of my class and received top grades in advanced computer science classes. Outside of my coursework, I have participated in various robotics programs and have studied computer science for 5 years now. I have over four years' tutoring experience, including teaching 3D software packages to students at MIT.
